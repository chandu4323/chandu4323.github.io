# Hello and Welcome! üëã
I'm **Chandu**, a **Data Scientist** and **Financial Analyst** who enjoys using data to uncover insights that drive business decisions. With a passion for machine learning and a strong background in financial analysis, I thrive on solving complex problems.

## My Skills:

## A Bit About Me:
When I'm not working with data, you'll find me diving into the latest tech trends, improving my coding skills, or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen (yes, I believe cooking is a form of data science too!). üç≤
